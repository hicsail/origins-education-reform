A collection of scripts for performing natural language processing tasks on digitized texts.
* ``XMLParsingScript.py -i input_files_folder_path -o output_files_folder_path``

    A script for converting the XML files that conform to the [Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)](http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml) format to a custom JSON format amenable to NLP transformations.
    * ``-i input_files_folder_path``

        Specify filepath to directory containing the input files (required).
    * ``-o output_files_folder_path``

        Specify filepath to output directory (required). The script will create a directory with the name you specify, so make sure the filepath you enter isn't already occupied by a directory of the same name.
    *"-f"
        
        Filter the raw text by removing stop-words and unnecessary characters, returning an array of individual words in each Json file. Note that if you specify the filtering argument, the script will take ~1 hour to run.
    
Example usage:

    python3 XMLParsingScript.py -i /Users/Ketchup/Desktop/Danish_Archive/ -o /Users/Ketchup/Desktop/Text_Out/
    
* ``WordFrequency.py``

    A script for performing a word frequency analysis and plotting the results.
    * ``-i input_files_folder_path``
        
        Specify filepath to director containing the input files(required).
    *``-o output_files_folder_path``
    
        Specify filepath to output file (required). The script will create a .txt file with the name you specify, so make sure the filepath you enter isn't already occupied by a directory of the same name.
        
    * ``-k "list_of_keywords" ``
    
        Specify which keywords you wish to perform a frequency analysis on. Separate unique words by spaces, and words with multiple spellings by "/".
        
    * ``-d "min max" ``
    
        Specify the min and max for which decades you would like the program to run the word count on. Separate each value by a space, and surround with quotes.
        
Example usage:

    python3 WordFrequency.py -i /Users/Ketchup/Desktop/Danish_Json_Corpus/ -o /Users/Ketchup/Desktop/Word_Frequency -k "test1 test2/test3 test4 test5/test6/test7 test8" -d "1700 1940"

* ``YearScraping.py``
    
    Parses an XML Directory and writes each XML file's Title/Author/Year of publication to a .txt file. It ignores XML documents whose chapter/text fields are empty. We're just using it to simplify the process of assigning years to documents, since the bulk of it will have to be done manually. The I/O is identical to XMLParsingScript.py above.

* ``HT_Parsing.py``

    Navigates the HT directories and extracts .txt files and their corresponding HTIDs. Then pairs each HTID with it's corresponding row in the HT CSV files and builds a Json file similar to those created by XMLParsingScript.py above.
    *``-i input_files_folder_path``
    
        Specify folder containing the HT directories/files (required).
        
    *``-o output_files_folder_path``
    
        Specify filepath to output directory (required). If the directory already exists, it will be overwritten.
        
    *``-d Document Type``
    
        Specify which type of documents are contained in the HT files (Fiction/Drama/Poetry). It will be used to populate
        the "Document Type" field in the Json files.
        
    *``-c csv_file_path``
    
        Specify path to the CSV file you will be using to populate each Json file's Author, Title, PubInfo, and Year fields. (required)
        Make absolutely sure that the CSV file is UTF-8 encoded, or the script will fail. If you do not know which encoding your CSV
        file uses, then open it with Notepad++ or SublimeText (or some text editor that lets you change encodings) and switch the 
        encoding of the file to UTF-8.

### Rsync Instructions:
