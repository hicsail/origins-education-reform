# origins-education-reform

A script for converting the Danish XML files to Json format. 
I/O flags:

-i: Filepath to input directory.
-o: Filepath to output directory. The script will create a directory with the name you specify, so make sure the filepath you enter isn't already occupied by a directory of the same name.

Example usage:

python3 XMLParsingScript.py -i /Users/Ketchup/Desktop/Danish_Archive -o /Users/Ketchup/Desktop/Text_Out
